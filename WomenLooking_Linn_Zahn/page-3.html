      <p class="text__paragraph text2__paragraph">
        The title and design of Josephine's "Women as Columns or Pillars...)" refers to stone carvings used in architecture, Caryatids; sculpted female figures (usually draped) used as pillars to support a traditionally Greek or Greek-style building. These women have many functions; they are decorative and welcoming, greeting an approaching visitor and guarding the doors, while simultaneously personifying larger than life, strong as stone supports for the entablature of the building. They are the guardians, they hold the weight in their hands and above their heads, and for a rare occasion in art history, the Caryatid came before her male counterpart Atlas, or Telamon. These strong, tall and beautiful women, could be  associated as a positive representation, one that recognizes their force, their care of community, of society, their progressive ideas. These stone bodies are feminist representations and they are everywhere. As Josephine so aptly continues in her title, women hold up, women are societal scaffolding, women are support structures.
